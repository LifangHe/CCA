\title{Nutrimouse dataset}
  \description{
    The \code{nutrimouse} dataset comes from a nutrition study
    in the mouse. It was provided by Pascal Martin from
    the Toxicology and Pharmacology Laboratory (French National
    Institute for Agronomic Research).

\usage{data(nutrimouse)}
\format{
  A list containing the following components:
  \item \code{gene}: data frame (40 * 120) with numerical variables
  \item \code{lipid}: data frame (40 * 21) with numerical variables
  \item \code{diet}: factor vector (40)
  \item \code{genotype}: factor vector (40)

}
\details{
Two sets of variables were measured on 40 mice:

\item expressions of 120 genes potentially involved in nutritional problems.
    
\item concentrations of 21 hepatic fatty acids.

The 40 mice were distributed in a 2-factors experimental design (4
replicates):

\item Genotype (2-levels factor):  wild-type and PPARalpha -/-

\item Diet (5-levels factor): Oils used for experimental diets
preparation were corn and colza oils (50/50) for a reference diet (REF),
hydrogenated coconut oil for a saturated fatty acid diet (COC),
sunflower oil for an Omega6 fatty acid-rich diet (SUN), linseed oil for
an Omega3-rich diet (LIN) and corn/colza/enriched fish oils for the FISH
diet (43/43/14).
